# Short Interest Trading Strategy
This strategy aims to generate returns by holding stocks with a low level of short interest and shorting stocks with a high level or short interest. Short interest refers to the total number of short sold shares of a stock that have not been covered or closed out.

## Strategy Hypothesis
Stocks that have a high level of short interest tend to experience negative abnormal returns. This is hypothesized to be because short sellers are often more informed traders and have superior analytical skills and are able to assess fundamental valuations better that the market. Subsequently, we can use the preditive power of the short interest ot generate returns in two ways, by holding stocks that have a low level of short interest and by shorting stocks that have a high level of short interest we can generate positive returns.

- Stocks with high trade volume but low short interest are significantly undervalued, both statistically and economically.
- Undervalued stocks exhibit larger positive abnormal returns compared to the negative returns on heavily shorted stocks.
- The pattern of undervaluation and high returns for low short interest stocks is consistent across different portfolio weightings and various market periods.
- Short sellers effectively identify overvalued stocks to short. They are also equally effective at avoiding undervalued stocks, indicating a high level of market acumen.

### Why Do Short Interest Levels Predict Stock Returns

[Link to the article](https://docplayer.net/5408283-Why-do-short-interest-levels-predict-stock-returns.html)
- Heavily shorted stocks (top 10% in short interest) underperform by 1.51% per month and by 1.72% when adjusted for risk.
- In the most heavily shorted group, the average short interest is 8.8% which corresponds to low monthly returns of just 0.52%.
- Stocks with low institutional ownership are correlated with negative future returns
- Stocks with low institutional ownership predict lower returns. This suggests that short-sellers are particularly good at identifying stocks with worsening fundamentals that lead to poor earnings results and negative news.
