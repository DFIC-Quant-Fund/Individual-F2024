**DFIC Quant Team â€“ Individual Project Proposal**

**Overview**

The project aims to capitalize on price fluctuations of Coinbase stock by leveraging the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MA). Assuming that Coinbase will remain in the 200 day mean, with occasional deviations providing trading opportunities. The strategy focuses on identifying when the 50-day MA crosses above or below the 200-day MA, signalling bullish or bearish trends, respectively.

**Hypothesis**

The hypothesis is that Coinbase's stock price follows predictable short-term trends based on its behaviour around these key moving averages. By executing trades when the 50-day MA dips slightly below or rises above the 200-day MA, profits can be generated during minor upswings or downturns, assuming the price consistently reverts to its mean.

- **Buy Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses *above* the 200-day MA, signaling a potential upward trend back to 200-day average.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses *below* the 200-day MA, indicating a downward trend. 

The expectation is to profit from short-term price deviations, assuming the price will revert to its mean over time, capitalizing on both upswings and downturns.
